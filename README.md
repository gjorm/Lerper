# Lerper
C# Scripts for my Android/iOS game Lerper

The code in this repo reflects many bad coding habits as I was learning both C# and Unity. There's a lot that I would do differently,
would I to do it again, including better OOP principles, smaller LerpGameController.cs file, more Singletons...

The core game logic is handled in LerpGameController.cs, PlayerController.cs, CameraController.cs and BlockController.cs
